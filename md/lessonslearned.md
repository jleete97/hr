## Lessons Learned

*Caveat: these are for me, a beginner.*

- Start with simple templates.
- Don't try to add routing until the templates are built.
- It's worth the time to build controllers initially with fake data, then build out services later.
- JS includes: app, services, controllers: controllers depend on services.
- Mind the punctuation (of course, but it's still the main issue sometimes).
